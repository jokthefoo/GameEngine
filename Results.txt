After running collision unit test for 90 seconds before changes:

LinkedList.GetAt 20%
Matrix Inverse 15%
Matrix Multiply 8%
CreateZrot 6.5%
Matrix vec multiply 4.5%

Two attempts at SIMD version of matrix multiply, both have made it worse.
Tried pulling in Joe's SIMD matrix multiply. Also made it worse.

LinkedList.GetAt 20%
Matrix Inverse 13%
Matrix Multiply 13%%
CreateZrot 6.5%
Matrix vec multiply 4.5%

Pulled in Joe's SIMD matrix inverse, which also made it worse.

LinkedList.GetAt 20%
Matrix Inverse 17%
Matrix Multiply 12%
CreateZrot 6.5%
Matrix vec multiply 4.5%


I think what is happening is by trying to use SIMD code it is forcing the compiler to compile down
to specific assembly code. But without the SIMD code the compiler is able to refactor the code to run 
even better than my SIMD code. Or I'm doing something wrong. Either way the biggest offender is my linkedlist
getat function, so the best optimization would be refactoring that or using a different structure.
